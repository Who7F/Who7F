- âš¡ Fun fact:On December 10, 1954 John Stapp went 632 mph (1,017 km/h) braking the last speed, and then came to abrupt stop. Experiencing a peak 46.2. And he walked away, though he was in great pain, and his eyes flooded with blood from the bursting of almost all their capillaries. Yeah, maybe don't try this at home.
