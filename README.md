- âš¡ Fun Fact: On December 10, 1954, John Stapp set a land speed record by reaching an astonishing 632 mph (1,017 km/h). What made this feat even more incredible was that he then came to an abrupt stop, experiencing a peak of 46.2 g-forces. Despite the extreme force, Stapp was able to walk away, though he was in significant pain and his eyes were flooded with blood due to the bursting of nearly all their capillaries.

Moral of the story: Maybe donâ€™t try this at home.
